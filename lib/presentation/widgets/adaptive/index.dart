/// These widgets automatically switch between Material and Cupertino

/// For built-in Flutter widgets with `.adaptive()` constructors, use:
/// - [Switch.adaptive]
/// - [Slider.adaptive]
/// - [AlertDialog.adaptive]
/// - [CircularProgressIndicator.adaptive]
/// - [Radio.adaptive]
/// - [Checkbox.adaptive]
/// - [RefreshIndicator.adaptive]
