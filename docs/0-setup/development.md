# Development Guidelines

## Test Coverage

We aim for a minimum of 80% test coverage across the codebase. Please ensure that any new features or bug fixes include appropriate tests to maintain or improve this coverage level.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

We encourage the use of Test Driven Development (TDD) practices. Write your tests before implementing the corresponding functionality to ensure that your code meets the required specifications from the outset.

When encountering bugs, please write tests that reproduce the issue before fixing it. This approach helps to verify that the bug has been resolved and prevents regressions in the future.

## Documentation

Refer to context7 for accurate documentation for libraries and frameworks used in this project. Proper documentation is essential for maintaining code quality and facilitating collaboration among team members.
